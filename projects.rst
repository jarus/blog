Projects
========

Most of my projects are written in Python but sometimes another language was just the better choice.

Open Source
-----------

All of my open source projects are hosted on `GitHub`_ or `BitBucket`_. Pull Requets are always welcome! Most of my projects are also tested on `Travis CI`_. 

Flask extensions
****************

My contributions to the `Flask extension`_ ecosystem.

.. github-repo:: jarus/flask-testing

.. github-repo:: jarus/flask-mongokit

.. github-repo:: jarus/flask-fillin

Flask applications
******************

Some projects to show the simplicity and elegance of `Flask`_ websites in code and functionality.

.. github-repo:: jarus/flask-rst

.. github-repo:: jarus/flacker

Munin plugins
*************

I like statistics of my servers and services. The most time I use `Munin`_ to generate some graphs but I want more graphs about special services so I wrote plugins for `Munin`_.

.. github-repo:: jarus/munin-prosody

.. github-repo:: jarus/munin-uwsgi
