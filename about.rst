About Me
========

Hi I'm Christoph Heer. I'm a keen developer focusing on web development together with other topics like instant messaging or other realtime communication stuff. Most of the time I use the `Python`_ programming language to create software.

I'm currently living in Walldorf (Germany) and doing some freelance work. In addition I'm working on some open source projects.

Contact
-------

If you want to contact me please use one of the following methods:

* the simplest and most effective way: `email`_
* the mainstream web 2.0 way: `twitter`_
* the programmer mainstream way: `github`_ or `bitbucket`_
* something between email and web 2.0: `xmpp/jabber`_
* old but still working: freenode irc

Most of the times I use the nickname ``Jarus``.

Open Source / About this website
--------------------------------

I'm a big fan of open source and you can find my projects on my `GitHub`_ and `Bitbucket`_ profiles. This website is also completely built on open source. `flask-rst`_ is working under the hood and does a great job from my point of view. The software is based on `Python`_ and `Flask`_ and is served by `Gunicorn`_ and `Nginx`_ running on a `Debian`_ server
