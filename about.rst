About Me
========

Hi I'm Christoph Heer. I'm a keen developer with focus on web development beside other topics like instant messaging or other realtime communication stuff. The most time I use the programming language `Python`_ to create software.

I'm currently living in Walldorf (Germany) and doing some freelancing work. In addition I'm working on some open source projects.

Contact
-------

Maybe you want to contact my than you can use one of this following methods:

* the simplest and most effective way: `email`_
* the mainstream web 2.0 way: `twitter`_
* the programmer mainstream way: `github`_ or `bitbucket`_
* something between email and web 2.0: `xmpp/jabber`_
* old but still working: freenode irc

The most time I use the nickname ``Jarus``.

Open Source / About this website
--------------------------------

I'm a big fan of open source and you can find my projects on my `GitHub`_ and `Bitbucket`_ profil. Also this website is full builded on open source. `flask-rst`_ is working under the hood and makes a great job in my eyes. The software is based on `Python`_ and `Flask`_ and is serving by `Gunicorn`_ and `Nginx`_ powerd on a `Debian`_ server.
