:summary: "I found a new great monospace font called Source Code Pro. Now I'm using it in my terminal and editor."

Normally I don't think too much about fonts. Okay, Comic Same is a NO GO. In terminals and editors the font should be monospace but personal I don't have more criteria for my favourite development font. Sure it should look nice. Before I switched to Source Code Pro I used Menlo which is also a nice monospace font which is default in Mac OS X.

In the 102. episode of the German podcast `MobileMacs <http://mobilemacs.de/2013/01/mm102.html>`_ there was a nice discussion about fonts specially for terminal and editors. Under the discussed fonts there was also Source Code Pro. This is a nice monospace font developed by Adobe. One target of the designers was to separate similar looking characters like the O and 0 (zero). The font is published under the "SIL Open Font License" and you can find the sources in the github repository.

I was too lazy to build the font by my one and so I downloaded it from `Google Web Fonts <http://www.google.com/webfonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Source+Code+Pro>`_. Now it is integrated into my Terminal.app and Sublime Text 2 and I really love it. Great work Adobe!
