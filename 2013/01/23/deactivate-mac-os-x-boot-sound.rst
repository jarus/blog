I like Mac OS X but sometimes the boot sound is very annoying such as in lectures. But you should regard that the sound is the result of the EFI self test. If there a problem of RAM or CPU than the melody is going to change. So please consider this first before you read more of this post.

If you still want to deactivate the boot sound than you should take a look to `StartNinja <http://www.allvu.com/index.php/sndownloadpage.html>`_. I tested it on Mountain Lion 10.8.2 and it works fine.
